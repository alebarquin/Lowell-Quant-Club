Model type:
A2C LSTMpolicy

Model training range and window size:
window = 30
t1 = 300
t2 = 666000

Model reward function:
if trade:
    current_price = self.prices[self._current_tick]
    last_trade_price = self.prices[self._last_trade_tick]
    price_diff = (current_price - last_trade_price) / last_trade_price

    # Modified to reward short positions as well
    if self._position == Positions.Long:
        step_reward += price_diff
    else:
        step_reward -= price_diff

I did not try to exclude overnight returns.

Model inputs:
indicator_list = [
            RSI, SMA_price_distance, MACD, MACD_signal, int_time]

Data:
Cleaned minute data for SPY ticker. Gaps are filled with a repeating value.
