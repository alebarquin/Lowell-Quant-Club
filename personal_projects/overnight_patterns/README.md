Overnight sessions, though minor in volume relative to day sessions, carry surprising significance. 
</br>
</br>
I provided a short block of code that graphs the separate overnight, intraday, and weekend returns. I also show strong negative correlations between the moving averages of these periods.
</br>
</br>
Furthermore, I show how aggressively and deliberately these profits are eroded at market open, and narrow down on the plausible causes of this phenomenon.

Further Questions:
</br>
</br>
What is the cause of these returns? (Some clues: the overnight returns broken down by weekdays appear similar across a wide variety of assets. The overnight/intraday symmetry is strongest in ranging SPACs. The overnight returns occur in small cap stocks with low volume and no options trading.)
</br>
</br>
Are strong sell-offs at open present in stocks that mainly attract retail traders who are not aware of overnight trends. 
</br>
</br>
Some large assets (ex. QYLD) already show that overnight returns outweigh morning sell-offs. Is it practical to use limit orders to avoid spreads and capture this profitably, or are fills ate the midpoint too difficult to achieve consistently?
